## Background / Overview
Helpful information that brings the reader a background context about the problem


## Problem
Describe the problem in detail and WHY we need to solve it. You can point out the opportunity, benefits for the users, what the competition does, and the most relevant insights.


## Goals and Success Metrics
What does success look like?
How do we know we are successful?
Using OKRs it's a good approach.


## Requirements / Key Features & Scope
What will you build? And more explicitly, what you won't make.
You can frame the requirements based on functional requirements (product-based) and non-functional requirements, like a system that must be highly available.


## High-level design
Block diagram with the core components needed to solve the problem. The idea is to be able to share this quickly with a jam-packed audience like executives.


## Detailed Design
Space to break down all the details and to go further into the research. It would be best to think about several possible solutions instead of just one approach. 
I suggest you apply a storytelling strategy to frame the details in a structured and sorted way the planned approach to build the required solution.
Ensure to include diagrams, repository links, API specs, code fragments, and so on. Adding everything that helps you visualize your approach better is essential. 


## Design Considerations
Identify possible bottlenecks and how you should solve them.

Here you can go deeper into considerations like expected traffic, storage and bandwidth required, etc. It's highly crucial to make the most out of this space to plan scalability elements such as: 
- Data partitioning and replication
- Data sharding
- Cache and load balancing
- Telemetry


## Alternatives considered 
Possible solutions discarded and WHY we aren't considering them.


## Risks, impact and dependencies
Do you depend on any other team or system to resolve this problem?
Identify if there are any risk elements to be aware of, it could be something technical or related to the business.
Considering if our proposed solution could impact other areas or systems is crucial.


## Security, privacy & compliance
Is there anything else that we can consider to implement the solution? Whether comply with determined regulations (like HIPPA compliance) or improve our infrastructure.


## Core UX|UI Flow
Wireframes and prototypes.


## Go to Market/collaborators
How do we plan to launch this? Do we need something from other departments like Ops or Sales?


## Fast follows
Features that aren't blockers nor essentials, but we should add them after the product launch.


## Links
Add valuable links to stand out your proposed solution.
